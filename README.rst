This package fills the gap between getting raw images from a camera driver and higher-level vision processing.

This Fork adds Tegra and fisheye support:

* camera_calibration_fisheye(https://github.com/DavidTorresOcana/image_pipeline/tree/indigo/camera_calibration_fisheye): A calibration tool for fisheye cameras. It uses OpenCV >3, NO CUDA support needed.

* image_proc_tegra(https://github.com/DavidTorresOcana/image_pipeline/tree/indigo/image_proc_tegra): 
 - A camera rectification package for camera rectification with OpenCV >3 and CUDA support. Tested in Tegra cores. Faster than image_proc since it uses CUDA for rectification

- It also implements a Nodelet for Fisheye cameras rectification, if calibrated with camera_calibration_fisheye(https://github.com/DavidTorresOcana/image_pipeline/tree/indigo/camera_calibration_fisheye). It uses OpenCV >3  with CUDA suport

* image_proc_fisheye (https://github.com/DavidTorresOcana/image_pipeline/tree/indigo/image_proc_fisheye): Rectification package for platforms without CUDA. Same as image_proc(https://github.com/DavidTorresOcana/image_pipeline/tree/indigo/image_proc) but for fisheye cameras calibrated with camera_calibration_fisheye(https://github.com/DavidTorresOcana/image_pipeline/tree/indigo/camera_calibration_fisheye). It uses OpenCV >3. NO CUDA support needed
